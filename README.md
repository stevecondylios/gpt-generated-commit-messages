# Installation

Simply add this to `.zshrc` (or just define it in a new terminal session):

```bash
git_diff_and_new_files() {
    echo "Git diff:"
    git diff "$@"
    
    new_files=$(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard)
    
    if [[ -n "$new_files" ]]; then
        echo -e "\nNew files:"
        echo "$new_files"
    fi
}

commit() {
  OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY # Store key in ~/.zshenv e.g. export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YZlDA7sk2hbv6G6F8jg0sdfsdfsdf" or can be added here directly. 
  GIT_DIFF_OUTPUT=$(git_diff_and_new_files)
  ENCODED_DIFF_OUTPUT=$(printf "%s" "${GIT_DIFF_OUTPUT}" | jq -sRr @uri)

  GPT_RESPONSE=$(curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d "{
    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",
    \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you give a prosaic commit message that summarises the changes represented by this \`git diff\` output: $ENCODED_DIFF_OUTPUT\"}],
    \"temperature\": 0.7
  }")

  COMMIT_MESSAGE=$(echo -E -n $GPT_RESPONSE | jq -r ".choices[0].message.content")

  if [ -n "${COMMIT_MESSAGE}" ]; then
    git add --all
    git commit -m "${COMMIT_MESSAGE}"
    git push
  else
    echo "Error: Couldn't generate a commit message."
  fi
}
```

and add your [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to `.zshenv` (or hard code it in the function above):

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YZlDA7sk2hbv6G6F8jg0sdfsdfsdf"
```

and you're ready to go!

# Usage

`cd` into any git repo, make some changes, and run `commit`. That one command will do the equivalent of

```bash
git add . 
git commit -m <GPT generated message>
git push
```

**A note on cost**

The GPT 3.5 turbo engine is 1/5th of a cent per 1000 tokens. Ref: https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis

A single commit can take up to about 4000 tokens.
